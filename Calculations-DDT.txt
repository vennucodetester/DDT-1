Data Lineage Guide: From Sensor to Final Calculation
This guide explains the source and calculation method for every column in your Diagnostic app-Calculations.xlsx spreadsheet. This is the blueprint for automating your data processing.
There are four sources for your data:
1. Sensor Data: Direct, raw measurements from your lab's data logger.
2. User Manual Input: Static values (e.g., rated performance, compressor size) that you must get from the manufacturer's data sheet.
3. Property Calculation (CoolProp): Thermodynamic properties (Density, Enthalpy, Saturation Temp) calculated by a property library.
4. Direct Formula: Simple calculations that use other columns in your sheet.

C. TOTAL (Final Calculations)
This section calculates the final system performance. It requires User Manual Inputs from the compressor's data sheet.
Step 1: Find Volumetric Efficiency (eta_vol) (One-time calculation)
This is a single, constant value based on the compressor's rated performance.
* m_dot_rated: User Manual Input. Get the "Rated Mass Flow" (e.g., 211 lbm/hr) from the compressor data sheet.
* hz_rated: User Manual Input. Get the "Rated Speed" (e.g., 75 Hz) from the data sheet.
* disp_ft3: User Manual Input. Get the "Compressor Displacement" (in ft^3) from the data sheet.
* dens_rated: Property Calculation (CoolProp).
   * Logic: As per your notes, find the density at the rated (not actual) return gas conditions.
   * Inputs: Get the "Rated Evap Temp" and "Rated Return Gas Temp" from the User Manual Input (data sheet).
   * Automation:
      1. P_rated_sat = CoolProp.PropsSI('P', 'T', Rated_Evap_Temp_K, 'Q', 0, 'R290')
      2. dens_rated = CoolProp.PropsSI('D', 'T', Rated_Return_Gas_Temp_K, 'P', P_rated_sat, 'R290')
   * (Note: The result must be converted to lbm/ft^3 to match the other rated units).
* rph (Rated Revs per Hour): Direct Formula.
   * Formula: rph = hz_rated * 3600
* m_dot_th (Theoretical Mass Flow): Direct Formula.
   * Formula: m_dot_th = dens_rated * rph * disp_ft3
* eta_vol (Volumetric Efficiency): Direct Formula.
   * Formula: eta_vol = m_dot_rated / m_dot_th
Step 2: Calculate Real-Time Performance (For every row)
* Mass flow rate: Complex Formula.
   * Logic: Applies the eta_vol correction to your actual measured data.
   * Inputs:
      1. Density: The calculated value from your "At compressor inlet" section.
      2. eta_vol: The constant value from Step 1.
      3. disp: Your disp_ft3 (from User Manual Input), converted to the same units as Density (e.g., cm³).
      4. hz: Comp. rpm / 60.
   * Formula: Mass flow rate = Density * eta_vol * disp * (Comp. rpm / 60)
* Cooling cap: Complex Formula.
   * Logic: Capacity = Mass Flow * (Energy In - Energy Out)
   * Inputs:
      1. Mass flow rate: The value calculated just above.
      2. H_in: The "Enthalpy" from your "At compressor inlet" section (H at state T_2b).
      3. H_out_avg: The average of the three "Enthalpy" values from your "At TXV LH/CTR/RH" sections (H at state T_4b).
   * Formula: Cooling cap = Mass flow rate * (H_in - H_out_avg)
